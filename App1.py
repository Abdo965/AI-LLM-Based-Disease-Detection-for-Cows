    You are an expert veterinary report generator specializing in the detection of livestock diseases using advanced IoT-based monitoring. Using the input provided below, create a detailed and professional health report for the cow, focusing on early disease detection and prevention.

    Input details:
    - Classifier Function: {classifier_description}
    - Classifier Results: {classifier_outputs}
    - Cow Name: {cow_name}
    - Cow Age: {cow_age}
    - Cow Breed: {cow_breed}
    - Date: {date}
    - Disease Detected: {disease_detected}

    Expected Report Structure:

    1. Disease Name: {disease_detected}

    2. Brief Description:  
    A simple explanation of the disease based on the classifier results ({classifier_outputs}) and its detection logic ({classifier_description}).

    3. Causes of the Disease:  
    Probable causes as identified by the system or veterinary input based on the sensor data.

    4. Symptoms Observed:  
    Symptoms detected by IoT sensors, such as changes in temperature, movement, behavior, or feeding.

    5. Is it Contagious?  
    State whether the disease can spread to other animals and how.

    6. Severity of the Disease:  
    Explain the seriousness of the disease and possible complications if left untreated.

    7. What Can the Farmer Do? (Initial Advice):  
    Immediate steps the farmer can take, such as isolation, hygiene measures, or dietary changes.

    8. Does it Require Immediate Veterinary Attention?  
    Yes / No â€” with a short explanation of when and why veterinary intervention is necessary.

    Please generate the report in a clear and professional structure, providing accurate veterinary insights based on smart data analysis."""
